# PuzzleGame_proto
This project is a little java/javafx puzzle game.
The finished game should contain many different singleplayer levels, a leveleditor, costumisation options and maybe a two player versus mode.
The goal of this game is to reach the stairs to finish a level. Thereby the player should solve puzzles, avoid/attack enemies and collect coins.
The player earnes coins (which will be calculated with the amount of moves, lives, collected coins and score).
Coins are used to buy themes, skins and elements for the leveleditor in the shop.
